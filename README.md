# Smartphone Usage Analytics 📱

## Overview
This project analyzes smartphone usage data to identify engagement patterns, retention trends, and behavioral clusters.  
The goal was to understand how user interactions evolve through a funnel-like flow — from initial app traffic → feature engagement → daily use → long-term retention.

## Objectives
- Measure and visualize daily and weekly engagement trends.  
- Identify drop-off points in user activity.  
- Segment users based on feature usage and session duration.  
- Provide actionable insights to improve user retention.

## Tools & Techniques
- **R**: tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, tidymodels  
- **Data Cleaning**: handling missing values, outlier filtering  
- **Visualization**: behavioral funnel and correlation heatmaps  
- **Statistical Analysis**: regression modeling, cluster grouping

## Key Insights
- Retention rates dropped by ~35% after the first week of usage.  
- Users who interacted with notifications retained 30% longer.  
- High-frequency users had shorter sessions but higher satisfaction.  

## Example Outputs
- `usage_summary.csv` — Cleaned dataset of user activity  
- `engagement_trends.R` — Script for time-based visualizations  
- `funnel_plot.png` — Visual funnel of user conversion stages  

## Takeaways
These insights informed recommendations to improve onboarding and notification timing, increasing retention and engagement consistency.
